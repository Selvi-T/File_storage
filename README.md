**File Uploading and Sharing**

This project facilitates decentralized image upload and sharing on the blockchain using Solidity for the smart contract and React for the front-end interface. It enables users to securely upload images to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and share access with specified users through smart contract functionality.

**Features:**

**Decentralized Storage:**
Files are uploaded to IPFS, ensuring decentralized and immutable storage.
**Smart Contract:** 
Utilizes Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for access control and ownership management.
**Access Control: **
Users can grant or revoke access to their uploaded files to specific individuals through the smart contract.
